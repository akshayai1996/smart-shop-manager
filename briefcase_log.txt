** WARNING: License Definition for the Project is Deprecated           **
*************************************************************************

    Briefcase now uses PEP 621 format for license definitions.

    Previously, the name of the license was assigned to the 'license'
    field in pyproject.toml. For PEP 621, the name of the license is
    assigned to 'license.text' or the name of the file containing the
    license is assigned to 'license.file'.

    The current configuration for the Project has a 'license' field
    that is specified as a string:

        license = "MIT"

    To use the PEP 621 format (and to remove this warning), specify that
    the LICENSE file contains the license for the Project:

        license.file = "LICENSE"

Briefcase configuration error: The `sources` list for 'shopease' does not include a package named 'shopease'.
